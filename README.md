1. To setup our app up you will need to be connected to the flight_tracking databases from mysql and have our repository ready to run.
   
2.  You will then need to call 'python app.py' in the terminal which will bring up our temporary website at 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'.
   
3. We decided the best way to set this up would be to use python, javascripts, mySQL, and a flask application. Using this stack made it very
   simple to set up our application and begin testing.

4. Work was distributed among the group evenly, as we all worked to debug and add necesarry procedures to the sql, as well as creating the flask application
    that the python and javascripts were integrated into.
